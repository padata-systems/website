# What is Padata? 

Padata is a data engineering community in Paris created in 2021.  
Our [official goal](https://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/associations/detail-annonce/associations_b/20210025/1266) is to "organise and facilitate meetings between data professional in the Paris region".   
Our *true goal* is to have fun and discuss with people sharing the same passion: data engineering.

## What do we do there ? 
3 things: 
- the staple: presentations of tech subjects. All members are invited to present something.
- the nice-to-have: drinks, networking, 2-min self-presentations.
- the differentiator: 1-2 hours sessions of pair-programming to get our hands dirty. 

## Sounds fun, how can I join ?
Joining the community requires **2** sponsors.    
If you don't have sponsors and you want to join, please reach out to the co-founders of the community.

Go the [apply page](./apply) to learn more.  


## Are there any strict, boring rules ?
Padata is a community. The community lives thanks to its members.
So yes, we have one (not-so) boring rule: 
- members should try their best to attend to the meetings. If they miss too much events, they may be excluded from the community. 

It's a single boring rule that ensures all events are interesting, so we think it's worth it.   

## Who is behind Padata ?
[Sergey Chernyakov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergey-chernyakov-81b08110b/) and me, [Cyril de Catheu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyril-de-catheu/), are the co-founder of Padata.  
Sergey is an experienced leader in infrastructure and data systems. I'm a data engineer with good experience in ML engineering. 
We met and worked together at AB Tasty. 
During our time there, we attended and enjoyed nice events organised by Criteo, Apache Beam, etc... but what we were missing was a sense of belonging: most of the events were organised by companies or frameworks.
We saw that there were a lot of independent machine learning communities that were doing well, so we decided to build our own community of data engineers !   

## So you really are independent ?  
We work with sponsors to make sure we have access to places, foods and other stuff without our members having to pay.  
Our amazing sponsors are:
